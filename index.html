The Amazons are entranced and confused. They all begin to laugh manically. They seem to completely forget about you, Mel and Hector. In the madness you manage to slip out and eventually make your way back to Turbine City. After everyone has healed up both mentally and physically the 3 of you collaborate on a book about your adventures. It is published and brings a tidy sum to each of you. Mel goes on to become Chief and Editor of the Turbine City Gazette. Hector leaves the truffle hunting business and opens a bar. And Tokyo Sexwhale? You go on to start your own puppet theatre, bringing joy to all who come to watch your shows. A happier ending there couldn't be... Or could there?",

I can see it now, candle light at sunset. But alas, I am humbled before you. Brought to you as a prisoner to gaze upon that which I cannot possess. She falters backward, plopping into her large wicker chair. Her eyes are glossed over and her cheeks flushed. She giggles, smiles, and says 'Go on...' You continue your charming rant and say 'I wish I could properly express myself but in my bound state it would be impossible. If you could untie me sweet lady I could thoroughly profess myself.' No sooner do you finish than she snaps her fingers signalling to two large women off to your periphery. You are quickly untied and brought to your feet.
